### Live Updating Time
To create the updating time I refered to dcode's video on YouTube, titled *Create a Digital Clock using Moment.js in JavaScript*. I shortened the code and implemented it to the page using jQuery however, dcode's method of seperating ```moment()``` from ```setInterval()``` was used to prevent delay of writing the time to the page when it is loaded or re-loaded.
